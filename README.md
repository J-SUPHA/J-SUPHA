### Hey there. My name is Jai Suphavadeeprasit!

I a person interested in the power of logic. 
I beleive that logic ,and as an extension technology,
is necessary to keeping people and entities relevant. 
I could say that technology has and can change the world but
come on. Hasn't it already. Not so say there is nothing to more
to do in tech. On the contrary - most of the major advancements
people will make will be through the medium of Tech. I aim to play
some part in that.

In the repositories of this profile you will find some of the projects 
that I have dabbled in. I do have other experience and am always looking to learn.

I started of wanting to do purely Finance but had a change of heart about 2-3 years ago.
Once I grasped how much could be done with the tools availible I became hooked learning about it . 

Below is are the titles of my two favorite movies. MoneyBall and Imitation Game.
